<h1>My favorite films of today</h1>
<hr />
<h2>The Best</h2>
<h3>Tampopo</h3>
<p>A film that almost perfectly explains human existance through food.</p>
<h2>The Most Beautiful</h2>
<h3>The Fall</h3>
<p>The most visually rich movie I've ever seen, even compared to powerhouse features like "In the Mood for Love" or "The Darjeeling Limited".</p>
<h2>The Best Soundtrack</h2>
<h3>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>I've never understood people who listen to soundtracks for pleasure, but the oribinal Star Wars boxed set was on eof the greatest Christmas gifts I have ever received.</p>
